### Description
Physics & gravity puzzle game. Just put the VHS tape in the VCR :) Completed during spring 2016 semester Georgia Tech, as a part of __VGDev__[^vgdev]<sup>, </sup>[^project]. 

### Goals
First and foremost, my goal was to lead a game to completion and create some engaging puzzles along the way. This was only the second game dev project I worked on with a team, and the first time I would be leading. I co-led the project with a very talented friend of mine, [Sean Flanagan](https://sflanagan33.github.io)

### Accomplishments
This was my first experience in project leading and also sharing a leadership role. This project also features the first 3D space, featured in the first screenshot, that I modeled, textured, and lit entirely from scratch! The initial story I proposed is wildly different to the result, but that in itself, was a great learning experience.

### Key Responsibilities
Project leading, level design, 3D modeling.

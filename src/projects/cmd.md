### Description

Physics-based desk organization game made while procrastinating cleaning my irl desk. Completed during spring 2018 semester at Georgia Tech, as a part of __VGDev__[^vgdev]<sup>, </sup>[^project].

### Goals

CMD started genuinely started as a way for me to procrastinate cleaning my real desk, and as 3D modeling practice, so the earliest goal was getting better at modeling props. Once I decided to convert this into a fully fledged game, my focus was on creating a chaotic but friendly aesthetic I pictured in my head, and to learn shader and editor development in Unity. I was very much inspired by games like Jet Set Radio and Katamari Damacy, and the entire body of work from [Nathalie Lawhead](https://alienmelon.itch.io/, "Nathalie's itch.io").

### Accomplishments

I learned a LOT about shaders and editor development! This is also the first large project where I really started to find my "style". It is arguably the least "game-like" game I led in VGDev, but players I've spoken to about or watched play CMD seem to "get" and like what I was going for and would always leave with a smile :)

### Key Responsibilities

Project leading, general programming, shader and editor programming, design, 3D modeling.

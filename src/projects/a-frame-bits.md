## Details 📝

#### [Code Repository](https://github.com/rhiannanberry/A-Frame-Experiments)

### Description
I got the opportunity to work with __AEL__[^ael] at Georgia Tech, and these are some little things I worked on to familiarize myself with __A-Frame__[^aframe].


### Demos
[Animation Rig](/REPLACE)
Quick and dirty example of how you can associate the animations of one FBX to the mesh/rig of a different FBX (given that they have the same armature/bones).

[Waypoints](/REPLACE)
Playing with generating waypoints in different shapes, as well as reactively revealing these waypoints.

## A Personal Commitment

I am someone who very much loves exploration, creation, and improving. How that can manifest, for better or worse, is a desire to redo a project as soon as I finish it. "I want to show off everything I learned! This old work no longer represents me!" I say, feverishly. There is certainly value in that, but do I really need to redo this website every year?
<br>
...
<br>
*(I don't, right? Please tell me that I don't)*

So this post is a personal commitment of sorts. I am promising myself that this iteration is absolutely *good enough!*... For at least another couple years. As well, I want to keep an archive of some of the old designs, because I'm quite certain I didn't leave them long enough for anyone, including myself, to appreciate.

## Born in the Wrong Generation (2016-2018)

I actually still really love this design, but there are *many* accessibilty issues and problems between browsers.

Oh, and to clarify, the title is a joke. I might be a zoomer/millenial cusp (zillenial?) but I grew up using Windows 95 and 98. I'm not *that* young.

## Sonic 2 Level Transition (2019-2020)

Not the most cohesive design. This was done with Jekyll and is actually the second or third iteration, though the earlier versions have been lost to the sands of time.

Great learning experience in terms of functionality, debatable in terms of visual quality.
